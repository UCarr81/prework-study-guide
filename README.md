## Description

Whenever I stare at my monitor, its a question I ask myself. "How can I make this work? Will It work? I accomplished this project for my own desire, to find a position in which I am comfortable doing working in. Since Highschool its always just been an idea I had, however since ive signed up for UO I been determined to not only make it an idea but my reality! ive learned lots making this mini projects and its surely to be helpful. I didnt find this project to be very stressfull but fun in a unique way, this truly is something I look forward to finishing.
